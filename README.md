4. Create the relative folder structure similar to 4-VAPrivComp-BERT, 5-Code/AVS-ComplianceAnalysis, and privacypolicies. Update the DB connection strings and any file paths.

5. Run Eunomia_run.bat to start the python scripts. Allow a few minutes only initially for the scripts to be ready for user's input. After about 5 minutes, start the chatbot. The outputs from skills will be checked for compliance by the python scripts. The compliance results will be saved under compliance_results.csv.
